<h2>About</h2>

<p>
    The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
    recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the king of the Lonely Mountain when
    Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire,
    Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
    Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash
    action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to
    leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill in to their party.

        <h3>Thorin II Oakenshield</h3>
        <p>
            In the year TA 2746, Thorin II was born to Dwarven prince Thráin II in the mountain city of The Lonely
            Mountain. Early in his youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the
            dragon Smaug in TA 2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated
            when he participated in the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He marched with one of the Dwarven armies
            beneath the East-gate of Moria. At some point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree
            branch found on the floor as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield," which would remain with him
            even in death.

        <h3>Fíli and Kíli</h3>
        <p>
            Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother Dís. They were also nephews
            of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thror. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his
            long nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves on the Quest of Erebor.

        <h3>Óin</h3>
        <p>
            Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. He usually wore a
            brown-hooded cloak when travelling. Óin fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield,
            and in TA 2941 joined with Thorin and Company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain wearing a brown
            hood. Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely
            Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin were usually in charge of preparing the fire for the Company. He fought
            in and survived the Battle of the Five Armies, and later settled in the Lonely Mountain along with many
            other dwarves of The Company of Thorin.

        <h3>Glóin</h3>
        <p>
            In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of the War of the
            Dwarves and Orcs. In TA 2941, Glóin and his brother Óin, along with his cousins Dwalin and Balin, were
            among the Dwarves accompanying Thorin and Company during their quest to the Lonely Mountain to recapture it
            from the Dragon Smaug. He was noted for his skills with a tinderbox, and, along with his brother Óin, was
            usually the one told to get a fire started whenever the Dwarves made camp. Gloin also fought in the Battle
            of the Five Armies. After the battle, he settled in the Lonely Mountain.

        <h3>Balin</h3>
        <p>
            Balin was likely born in the Lonely Mountain before the coming of the dragon Smaug. He had a younger
            brother named Dwalin, and was amongst those driven from their homes when Smaug attacked the Lonely
            Mountain. Afterwards, he may have lived in Dunland as a refugee, before fighting in the War of the Dwarves
            and Orcs which culminated in the Battle of Azanulbizar. Many years later, in approximately TA 2841, he
            accompanied Thráin II, the father of Thorin, when he attempted to go back to the Lonely Mountain himself,
            but Thráin was captured and lost.

            Born in TA 2772, two years after the dragon Smaug had desolated Erebor, Dwalin was the son of Fundin and
            younger brother of Balin. After fighting in the Battle of Azanulbizar at the age of 27, Dwalin accompanied
            Thrain the Second and Thorin Oakenshield to settle peacefully in the northern Ered Luin.

        <h3>Ori</h3>
        <p>
            Ori lived in Thorin's Halls in the northern Blue Mountains for many years. In the year TA 2941, Ori became
            a member of Thorin's Company and travelled with Thorin, Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins, and the other dwarves on
            the quest for the Lonely Mountain, culminating in the death of Smaug. Finally, he and the other dwarves of
            Thorin's Company fought in the Battle of the Five Armies, and he survived it.

            Before The Quest of Erebor, Dori lived in Thorin's home in the northern Blue Mountains with Nori and Ori.
            In TA 2941, Dori and his two brothers became part of Thorin and Company, befriending Bilbo Baggins and
            traveling with him in search of Smaug's treasure at the Lonely Mountain.

            Nori was the brother of Dori and Ori. Both Nori and Dori were capable flutists, and seem to have carried
            their flutes with them. Both these apparent brothers also shared Bilbo's liking for regular meals. Before
            the Quest for the Lonely Mountain, Nori lived in Thorin's Halls in the northern Blue Mountains with his two
            brothers.

        <p>
            Whilst he was a descendant of the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm, Bifur was not of Durin's Folk. Most of his
            familial relations are unclear, and what is known of his parentage is very little. He and his family were
            driven out of their home in the Lonely Mountain by the Dragon Smaug, and were forced to live in exile,
            where the Dwarf warrior worked as a toy maker. Following Thorin II Oakenshield to a new life in the Blue
            Mountains, he continued his life as a toy maker.

            Bofur was a descendant of the Dwarves of Rhudaur, but was not of Durin's Folk. He and his family hailed
            from the Blue Mountains. As such, they felt less strongly about the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain
            from the dragon Smaug, more interested in the adventure than a home they'd never seen.

        <h3>Bombur</h3>
        <p>
            Bombur's parentage is unknown; the only familial connections mentioned are his brother Bofur and his cousin
            Bifur. Bombur was not of Durin's line although he was descended from Dwarves of Moria. His birth year is
            also unknown, however, from Bilbo Baggins' account from the quest to Erebor it is known that the brothers
            Fíli and Kíli were the youngest of the 13 "by some fifty years" and that after Thorin had been captured,
            Balin was "the eldest left". Since Fíli was born in TA 2859 and Balin was born in TA 2763, this would put
            Bombur's birth between 2763 and 2809, and he would have been between 132 and 178 years old during the quest
            to Erebor. Prior to the quest Bombur probably lived in the Blue Mountains with Thorin after the loss of
            Thráin II.

        <h3>Bilbo Baggins</h3>
        <p>
            Bilbo Baggins was born on September 22 by Shire Reckoning (around September 12-14 of our calendar), in the
            year 2890 of the Third Age. He was the only son of Bungo Baggins and Belladonna Took.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Hobbiton, Bungo Baggins constructed a spacious and luxurious Hobbit-hole for Belladonna, which they
            named Bag End. The family moved to their new home, where Bilbo would spend much of his life.

        <h3>Gandalf</h3>
        <p>
            When he arrived to Middle-earth, he received Narya, the ring of fire, from Círdan the Shipwright.
            Olórin, renamed Gandalf, spent many centuries walking among the elves as a stranger, learning from them and
            teaching them. He later revealed himself as one of the Istari, and eventually became known as the wisest of
            and most powerful of that order. He joined the White Council, which was formed to investigate a dark power
            in Dol Guldur, of which Galadriel wanted him to become the leader, yet Saruman came to lead the Council
            instead of him. Although Saruman was initially more powerful and more knowledgeable about many matters
            regarding Sauron and the Rings of Power, and was head of the White Council before the War of the Ring, he
            later grew jealous and afraid of Gandalf, which was the reason of his betrayal.
